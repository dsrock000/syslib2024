# Week 8 - LAMP

#### Reflections
- Installation was straightforward
- I may struggle with some steps if I try to do this again in the future
- I am curious to find other sources for these instructions for future use and reference
- Typing html and php code into Linux cli makes me cringe. I prefer to write code elsewhere and copy and paste.
