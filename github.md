##GitHub Reflections

I've learned some basics of markdown like **bold** and *italics*. I've never used it before. It seems really easy until it doesn't work right! 

The toughest part of using markdown is when the unexpected happens. I had multiple issues and most were caused by an extra space. 

I learned how to include the link to where I work: [College of Pharmacy](pharmacy.uky.edu)

I also learned how to create new files and the basics of using github for documentation.

I've rarely used github, so I'm interested to learn why it's so popular.

It was interesting to go back and look at my commit history and I can see how it could be really helpful.
