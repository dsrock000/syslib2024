I'm **excited** to try bold in markdown. 

Markdown seems *easier* to do italics than in html, so that's great! 

Be careful when using the 'rm' or delete command in Linux. I was tired and accidentally deleted my project once. Some linux commands are intuitive like 'cp' for copy and others are not. 

A fun example code block:

```
echo $what does this do"
done
```

Here is a picture from work when we got to meet Justice Gorsuch: ![Justice Gorsuch](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/feffe2_8d4ac623fe714f189110eb33f5f2384c~mv2_d_3456_5184_s_4_2.jpg/v1/fill/w_461,h_692,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/feffe2_8d4ac623fe714f189110eb33f5f2384c~mv2_d_3456_5184_s_4_2.jpg)

## I'll stick with the theme and add a Justice Gorsuch quote

>A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge...
>stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands.
