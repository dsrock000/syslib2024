I'm **excited** to try bold in markdown. 

Markdown seems *easier* to do italics than in html, so that's great! 

Be careful when using the 'rm' or delete command in Linux. I was tired and accidentally deleted my project once. Some linux commands are intuitive like 'cp' for copy and others are not. 

A fun example code block:

```
echo $what does this do"
done
```

Here is a picture from work when we got to meet: ![Justice Gorsuch] (https://dsrock0.wixsite.com/my-site/media?pgid=kl42e5uq-23eabb07-15de-45fe-8dfd-85cb752410e7)

## I'll stick with the theme and add a Justice Gorsuch quote

>A judge who likes every outcome he reaches is very likely a bad judge...
>stretching for results he prefers rather than those the law demands.
