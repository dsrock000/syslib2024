## Reflections

- It was a pretty straight forward week.
- I did have to look back at steps from last week to connect to MySQL and select a database.
- I couldn't figure out why my MySQL insert commands weren't working right.
- I walked away and noticed a pending reboot when I came back.
- I used the exact same command and it worked perfectly.
