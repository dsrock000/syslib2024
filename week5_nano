# Nano Editor

## Initial thoughts
Using nano editor feels *odd*. It reminds me of the first word processor I used a really long time ago. 
Copying and pasting shouldn't be this hard. I got it down now, I think. 
It's hard to stop myself from using my mouse. It just gets me into trouble. 

## Things to remember
- Write out means save
- Ctrl-0 saves the document
- Ctrl-x exits the program
- Where is means search
- Cursor location is very important
- Highlighting words or lines with the mouse doesn't work
- Alt-6 copies text
- Ctrl-k cuts text
- Ctrl-u pastes text
